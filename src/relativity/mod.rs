//! # Theory of relativity
//! The theory of relativity usually includes two interrelated theories
//! by Albert Einstein: Special & General relativity
//! Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in absence of gravity
//! while General Relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces in nature.
//! It includes the concepts of spacetime, simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time dilation and length contraction
//!
//! ## Special Relativity
//! The theory of special relativity was published on the 26. September 1905 in Einstein's famous paper "On the electrodynamics of moving bodies"
//! ("Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter KÃ¶rper")
//!
//! The term "Theory of relativity" was coined in 1906 by Alfred Bucherer in the discussion section of Planck's paper
//!
//! ## General Relativity
//! General Relativity was developed in the years 1907-1915.
//!
//! ## About this collection of equations
//! This folder includes a number of files in which a number of functions are written down. Those functions
//! are Rust-Versions of some of the most famous equations. I do not claim this to include implementations
//! for all - or even just many - equations that are regarded as important in the context of relativity.
//! The theory is huge, and so is physics as a whole. I am not capable of adding all of the functions required
//! to make this feature-complete while not completely ignoring all other areas of physics. If you believe that an important
//! concept or equation is missing, implement it.
